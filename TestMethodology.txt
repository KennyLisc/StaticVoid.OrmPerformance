Each ORM will be requested to perform a set of singular and batched database interactions by the harness.
These will be timed and used to present a comparison on the reletive speed of the framework

To ensure minimal inteference the following precautions have been taken:
 - before each test the database is completely torn down and re-built
 - The order of the Tests is random so they may occur in any sequence
 - The tests are run multiple times
   - the worst results for each test case (per ORM) are discarded to cater for external circumstances
   - the mean of the test runs is taken as the time for that specific test.

The following test will be performed for each ORM, X will be varied to produce a graph
 - inserting X distinct rows into a table
 - updating X distinct rows
 - deleting X distinct rows
 - running a query to select X distinct rows
 - running X distinct, single row select statements
